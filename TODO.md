## **TODO**

Use current Norbert data without GPS to have a look at data and get the
analysis going

Overall plan

1.  > As Norbert is away, use old RALSpace database for videos instead

2.  > Get data and get rid of sky (even roughly)

3.  > Single goals: generate some IDFs (via rotating and see what the
    > shape is like) from a few places (aim for Weds 15th July)

4.  > See if there are some good/bad places

5.  > Do obvious things like histeq and maybe low res to see if it helps
    > bad places

6.  > Repeat for multiple goals and see if we can get a general picture
    > of how many bad places and what are they like

7.  > How can we overcome these issues?

8.  > Can we use any measures to decide \*not\* to use any images as
    > snapshots/training images?

Alongside this need to get better data

  - > Get Norbert to get the robot

  - > Get him to assess how good the GPS is when synched

  - > Get a new data set (make sure to repeat any routes used several
    > times)

Once we have a general picture

  - > Establish baseline and look at infomax

  - > Potentially do more rigorous/targeted tests (generate points with
    > occlusion/bumpy ground?)

  - > Look at a very long route

  - > Look at other DBâ€™s

  - > Find an alternative algorithm to test against
